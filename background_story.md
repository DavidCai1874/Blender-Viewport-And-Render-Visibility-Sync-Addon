Story time:

This all started with a morphing animation I was working on. These are part of the final result:

And, obviously, I'm the person who forgot to key the render visibility. I rendered the first half and was like, "Why are the cactus and other things still there..."

Unfortunately, I didn't get the script to work at that time—it keyed every frame and worked SO SLOW.

But luckily, I was using Eevee to render, so I used the viewport render and the result was quite acceptable.
